    "# Problem 2: Visualize an interactive map (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a nice interactive map using the skills you leared in lesson 5: interactive maps using Folium (or some other suitable package - feel free to experiment!). Write your code into a notebook file (.ipynb) or a python script file (.py) and store the output map(s) in .html format under the docs folder.\n",

    "Topic of the map:\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can select the topic of the map freely.\n",
    "    This map should not be only an interactive version of your submission for problem 1 ;). Create something new!\n",
    "    Feel free to adapt examples provided in this course!\n",
    "\n",
    "Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The map should have multiple layers on it and/or present an output of (simple) data analysis (something beyond plotting raw data on a map).\n",
    "    Consider good cartographic practices\n",
    "    The map should demonstrate skills learned during lesson 5: interactive maps and throughout this course. You can also take advantage of the Folium example gallery for further ideas.\n",
    "    Think about including additional interactive elements, such as popup text in the map.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Remember to commit the code and input data (or at least a link to input data)\n",
    "    Save your map(s) in .html format in the docs folder\n"
